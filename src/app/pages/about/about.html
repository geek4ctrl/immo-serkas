            <h3>Mr. Serge Kasanda Lusamba</h3>
            <p>Serge Kasanda Lusamba, Congolese (DRC) nationality, born in Mbuji Mayi on September 7, 1965. The journey of Serge Kasanda "SERKAS" inspires respect and admiration. This business enthusiast is a true self-made man. He began his post-university life as a simple worker in a company 1 km from Charleroi in Belgium, as a Senior Technician and Section Head, then continued as an office supplier in Southern Africa before launching into business with the success we all recognize today. It all started in Belgium in 1994 with the creation of an agency called "KAS-CONTACT" which became a major contact office for various businesses (Import-export, Air and sea freight, facilitation and consulting). SERGIO and FILHOS SPRL was the first stone of what would become the SERKAS group today - a giant operating in several countries in Southern Africa.</p>
